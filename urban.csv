Which bus line(s) do you use most often in Almere?	What time do you usually leave for work/school?	How long is your one-way commute?	How many days per week do you commute?	How crowded is your usual bus during peak hours?	What issues frustrate you most about Almere Bus line?	Do you currently use any app to check bus schedules ? 	Taking public transport is convenient for me.	Most people I know use public transport or recommend it.	I can easily change my travel time if I want to avoid a crowd.	I would change my departure time if I knew my usual bus was full.	I care about reducing traffic congestion and pollution.	I feel in control of when and how I travel during the week.	I rarely think about how crowded the bus will be when planning my trip.	Even if a bus is full, it doesn't affect my travel choices.	If your usual bus is 90% full when it arrives, what would you most likely do?	Would you be open to using an app that gives personal travel advice based on real-time crowd levels?	Why do you prefer (or not prefer) avoiding crowded buses?	Does this current app show the crowd level in the buses	  Would you be willing to use an app that not only shows how full a bus is likely to be, but also provides feedback on your travel habits based on a brief conversation with a chatbot  	  Would you be open to having a short 3–5 step conversation with a chatbot about your journey, instead of using traditional origin–destination travel apps, in order to receive personalized travel suggestions tailored to your specific trip  	Column 26	Column 25
